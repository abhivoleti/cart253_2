brainstorm for mod jam-
two characters(the user gets to pick which character they want to play)
can either be the frog or the fly
pokemon leaf green intro(i want the start screen to be a similar version of the pokemon game is)
create two options whether to fight or run(trying to recreate pokemon leaf green batlle where you choose to fight run pick a pokemon or look through your bag but instead there are only two options)
if youre the frog the mission is to catch the fly
if youre the fly the mission is to escape the fly(but instead there will be 3 frogs)
photoshop background, characters and texts to make it look similar
perhaps the user gets to choose the difficulty(the fly will move faster the harder the level/the frog's tongue will move faster)
will have a designated instructions button(but will pop up only when you click the button on the screen)
will add music to the game(maybe ambient)
will keep a score check(maybe will keep a high score)
perhaps a timer too
a game over screen 
totally forgot but the characters will only be controlled by keys and not mouse
make a pixelated version of frog and fly 
perchance add some emotes to the characters lol 
the fly will be able to move in x and y direction 
the frog will only move in x direction
a buzzer sound when the user loses 
maybe like super mario the if youre a fly you can collect coins 
you get to buy a life if you redeem 100 coins(but again you need to collect 100 coins in one game)
