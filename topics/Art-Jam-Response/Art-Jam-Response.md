The first project that I would like to talk about is Edmond’s which is easily one of my favourites. The project features photos of different parts of his body clipped into circular shapes titled Fragments of the Self.​​ The circles spin around a cursor and each one reacts differently when you hover over it. For instance when the cursor touches his nose, the image zooms in, slows down, and the image becomes very grainy. When it's on his ears they blur and the spinning slows; When its lips the circle shrinks and when its eyes the circle zooms in, turns grainy and the entire screen turns black. Each circle move with a different pace– his hands spins the fastest while also having no reaction to the cursor(strangely), while his ears move the slowest; there's also a moment  where all these circles converge at one point sort of like the old dvd logo screens where you’d wait for the logo to bounce perfectly into the corner. 

The next project that really resonates with me is Leah's and I'm so glad I got to hear her explain how beautifully it represents her. She likes to define the falling star, what she calls “Stardrops” as a reflection of herself, with the changing speed of the star's constant growth. When they begin to fall rapidly, it mirrors the feeling of being overwhelmed by the change, almost as if she's crashing down. There's something about stars that has always fascinated me. I could spend a lifetime staring at them and the fact that my own project also revolves around stars and how it makes me feel like home says a lot about  how even the smallest things drifting across the sky can represent who we are. In Leah's project, all the stars seemed to be placed at about a 75degree angle, each one in a different color with a subtle drop shadow that gives them a  glittery look luminous effect, all moving with a different pace. This is such a minimalistic yet a deep way to capture one's state of being. 

The last project that caught my eye is Ahmad’s really intriguing self portrait. The first thing you notice is the character who I’d like to call Ahmad, since it's a self portrait with his eyes open at first, but they slowly close as the blue shade in the background gets darker. It gives this feeling that the later it gets, the heavier your eyes feel like a universal kind of tiredness that kicks in as the night falls. You also see the sun turn into the moon, which adds to that natural shift from day into night. The interactive part is especially interesting; when you click the mouse, the eyes turn red and keep getting darker the more times you click the mouse. I vividly remember Ahmad saying that the click feels like a hit; it's meant to show pain. One detail that stands is how the eyeballs shrink and grow, almost like during the day you're wide-eyed and full of energy and at the night you're just pushing through the tiredness trying to stay up
