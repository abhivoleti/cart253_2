    <p>this island is for music you find with your body, not your feed. it’s the feeling of stepping into a record shop and hearing something you’ve never heard before, or seeing a small band play for twenty people who actually care. it’s for sounds discovered by wandering, touching, asking, listening. a reminder that real music still exists outside algorithms  you just have to go out and find it.</p>
