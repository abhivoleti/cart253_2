I want to start by saying that Sama’s mod jam project was easily the most visually impressive thing I’ve seen this semester. The visuals are genuinely fantastic. The game opens with a screen that says “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT; click to begin scan.” Interestingly, that ended up being the only instruction I could find, and honestly the only real flaw I noticed because after that, I wasn’t totally sure what I was supposed to do. Maybe that’s on me, but it did take a bit of trial and error to understand the goal. The start screen also has this VHS-style glitch overlay in the bottom right corner, which immediately grabbed my attention. Once you click in, you’re dropped into the actual game world and prompted to scan. You can sort of see this red flaming object. I believe that’s what you’re supposed to scan? And then suddenly there are ten red skulls with flames shooting out of their eyes.That was absolutely insane what Sama did over there. I still don’t understand how they did that. And the background—wow. There’s this intense spectrum-style distortion happening the whole time. I couldn’t stop staring at it, even though it definitely made me a little dizzy in the funniest way.
After you finish taking out the skulls, you’re hit with a new objective: taking down this big, ugly monster that drops stink bombs. It actually took me multiple attempts to realize you were meant to shoot the monster, not the bombs themselves. Once I finally understood that, I managed to get through it—but then I hit another roadblock: after defeating the monster, nothing happened. The game just… kept going, with no clear ending. So I guess I’ll have to talk to Sama and figure out what I missed.

The second project I want to talk about is Edmond’s. I really love the color choices and the font used in the text. They work so well together and the frog itself is quite adorable. It might sound a little ridiculous , but the way the flies move is exactly how I’d imagine them moving just from looking at the game’s UI and overall style. Everything feels very cohesive.
The gameplay is simple but fun: you use the arrow keys to move the frog, try to avoid a giant wooden block that’s constantly trying to smash your head, and eat as many flies as possible. The wooden block is a great addition, blends in very well and once again feels very cohesive.
There’s also this yellow fly that is basically impossible to catch. I actually had to sit there and do some plotting just to get it once. And then, of course, the moment the wooden block finally lands on your head, you’re sent to heaven where the number of flies you’ve eaten turns into your total “happiness” score before your untimely departure. It’s weirdly very adorable 

The final project I want to talk about is Blaise’s. He completely flipped the original frog game concept and turned it into an asteroid style game, which I thought was a genuinely brilliant decision. Almost everyone stuck pretty closely to the frog idea, so the fact that he leaned into something so familiar and something almost all of us have played at some point made his project stand out immediately. It’s funny that he was the one of the few(i did as well hahahaha) who tapped into that nostalgia.
I don’t even need to explain the gameplay because it follows the classic format: you take down as many asteroids as you can, and the speed keeps increasing based on how many you destroy. It’s not exactly a one to one replica of Asteroids, though, since the “spaceships” are replaced with circles of different shapes, which adds a nice twist.
One thing I liked is that the background circles speed up depending on how many ships you destroy. It’s a small touch and works wonderfully well.
