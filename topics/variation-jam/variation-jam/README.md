## Description
I made a simple pixel-style game using an old TV-cable UI as the home screen. It has three modes  bullets, toilet paper, and spaghetti  and each one shoots toward you at a random speed. Your only job is to jump and dodge whatever comes your way.

I tried using GIF in my project for the first time and im happy with the way how it turned out!!!
