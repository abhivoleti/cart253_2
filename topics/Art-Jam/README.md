## Description

Often, I find myself going to the park near Westmount, up the hill, and staring at the stars whenever i feel low. Its like a small escape, a moment to breathe whenever things feel a lil too much 

Lately, life has been overstimualting, and i feel very unaccomplished; even with this project. I had been working on a football game for almost a week or two now, making fields on photoshop, creating my own characters but unfortunately, i got sick and couldnt continue which left me stuck

I ended up rushing thru this new project and it didnt fully satisfy me or reflect by best abilites. Still i realize this is the best way i can capture myself right now. I feel tired and just want to be home. This is it. Setting Sun
